    <p><strong>30 Days of Tickets</strong> is a data visualization of one month's worth of parking violations from the City of Philadelphia. The data was extracted from <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/" target="_blank">OpenDataPhilly</a>, the city's awesome effort to share information with the public. At this point, <strong>30 Days of Tickets</strong> only covers one month because the sheer volume of data was overwhelming &mdash; the cityâ€™s parking data is available going back to 2012! <strong>30 Days of Tickets</strong> is styled to conform roughly to Phila.gov's <a href="http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/patterns/" target="_blank">standard web design patterns</a>.</p>

    <p>The application also implements <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/web/" target="_blank">Google Maps API with JavaScript</a>. <strong>30 Days of Tickets</strong> is built on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails</a> and uses the <a href="https://github.com/gazay/gon" target="_blank">Gon Gem</a> to pass data from the controller to JavaScript.</p>
